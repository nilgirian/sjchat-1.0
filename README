What is SJChat (Simple Java Chat)?

SJChat is an example of a Java applet web chat.  I intend it to be a
starter-kit for coders who want to create thier own chat and program in thier
own features.  SJChat works in two programs: The Server and Client.  The
Server is the C code in the './src' directory, and the client is the Java
code in the './WWW/Applet.dir' directory.  I'll leave it to you to decipher
the source.


How does it work?

You load the './WWW/index.html', web page, and if you're lucky the applet
will start up a web chat. :)  You'll need Java (JDK 1.0.2 or better).


How do I get started?

1. 'cd' into the './src' directory and type 'make'.
2. Likewise, 'cd' into the './WWW/Applet.dir' directory and type 'make'.
3. If you've gotten this far without any problems, then you'll need to make a
   decision on how you're going to make the './WWW' accessable from the web.
   From the sjchat directory you can do something like:

		mv WWW ~/www/mychat

   (assuming '~/www' is your web directory)

   or 'cd' into your web directory and do something like:

   		ln -s ~/where/ever/sjchat/WWW mychat

   Basically, what you want to do is keep the directory heirarchy the way that
   it is in the the './WWW' directory. So you can move 'Applet.dir' and
   'Library.dir' into your web directory, and copy 'index.html' into your
   web directory as 'mychat.html'.

4. Start the server.  The server needs to be running in order for the Java
   applet client to work.  For those of you running csh try:

   		./sjchatd >>& /dev/null &

   or those using bash try:

		./sjchatd >> /dev/null 2>&1 &

   You can replace /dev/null with a filename and system messages will be
   written out to that file.

5. With the server up and running and the Java classes, and 'index.html'
   available from the web you should be able to load the 'index.html' file
   with a Java capable web browser and see the web chat.


Why JDK 1.0?

Because not everyone on the web is using the latest and greatest version.


Will I add more to this?

Probably not.  If I do add more, it will be something basic, or maybe an
improvement of the documentation :). The key here is "Simple".  This chat
is here for you to RYO web chat.  There are a lot of possibilities from where
this code stands right now.  It is up to a few brave souls who believe in the
CopyLeft policy to come up with something better.





If you do end up making a bigger and better web chat from SJChat, or you
are using it as is.. I'd like to know :)
