Project: sjchat-1.0.
1,336 lines of Java code.

This is a (S)imple (J)ava Chat program and my first GPL release wayback from
1998. It's a fairly simple Java 1.0 client/server web chat model. It made its
way into Linux distros at the time.

This program had a decent run and was put into use by several individuals and
organizations at the time as rudimentary as it was.
